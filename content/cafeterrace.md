**Vincent Van Gogh**


Famously painted by Vincent Van Gogh, this piece was made in 1888 depicting a night scene by the Rhône River. This painting features a starry landscape, often depicted in Van Gogh's artwork as painting nightlife was one of his interests. This piece is similar to the popular "Starry Night" which also has a nighttime landscape. 

This artwork is considered a piece of Post-Impressionism, during the period of 1886 to 1905. The media used here is oil paint on canvas, with bright colors to display the boldness of the Rhône River scenery.
