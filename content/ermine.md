**Leonardo da Vinci**

The following painting was created by famous painter, Leonardo da Vinci, was made in c. 1489-1491 as a portrait of mistress Cecilia Gallerani. Leonardo uses an ermine as the animal in her arms, and while it is too large compared to an actual ermine, it is said to symbolize its large nature of purity and moderation. In classical literature, the ermine was also known as an animal that protected pregnant women. Because Cecilia was rumored to be pregnant at the time, an ermine was a fitting animal.

This artwork was made using oil paint on a walnut panel. There are several layers of paint to this piece with shades of brown undertones. This painting was also made during the High Renaissance period in Italian states that started in 1490.
