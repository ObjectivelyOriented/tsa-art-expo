**Grant Wood**

This artwork, created by Grant Wood, was made in 1930 to portray the rural Americans he has pictured in Eldon, Iowa. While some interpret this as a satirical comment on rural towns, others saw it as an appreciation of small town life. The painting was also highly influenced by the effects of the Great Depression and it started to represent the spirit of American pioneers.

The painting was influenced by the Expressionism period in the 1920s and follows the neo-Gothic architectural style of the house in the background. It is an oil painting on beaverboard that can now be found at the Art Institute of Chicago.
