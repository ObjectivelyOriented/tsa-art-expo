**Michelangelo**

Michelangelo painted this piece in 1512. The connection in this painting between the fingers of Adam and God, which symbolises the spark of life being created, is very popular in it's own right. The panel to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel which includes this work came towards the end of the overall installation of the completed art work. Creation of Adam in the Sistine Chapel is amongst the biggest tourist attractions within Italy and has been for many years, with regular work being completed in order to ensure that the extraordinary fresco does not become damaged over time, having already covered the past 500 years.

The Creation of Adam differs from typical Creation scenes painted up until that time.  Here, two figures dominate the scene: God on the right, and Adam on the left.  God is shown inside a floating nebulous form made up of  drapery and other figures.  The form is supported on angels who fly without wings, but whose flight is made clear by the drapery which whips out from underneath them. God is depicted as an elderly, yet muscular, man with grey hair and a long beard which react to the forward movement of flight.
