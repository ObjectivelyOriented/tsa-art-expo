**Edvard Munch**

"The Scream" was a popular oil painting made by Edvard Munch in 1893. It was created to represent the anxiety and agony of the human condition as a result of nature. As explained by Munch himself, the red sky depicted came from a sense of "infinite scream passing through nature." Other theorists explain that the painting might have been inspired by the artist's memories of the volcanic eruption of Krakatoa. This painting was made during the Proto-Expressionism period.

Munch's artwork is a multi media painting, made with oil paint, tempera, pastel, and crayon. He made four versions of this painting, two with paint and two with pastels, all of which are on display at art galleries today. He also used very bright colors in his composition to bring out the emphasis of the "scream of nature."
