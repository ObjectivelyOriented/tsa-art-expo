**Pablo Picasso**


This painting was created by Pablo Picasso in 1903 during his famously known "Blue Period". The bent and sightless man holds close to him a large, round guitar. Its brown body represents the painting's only shift in color. Both physically and symbolically, the instrument fills the space around the solitary figure, who seems oblivious to his blindness and poverty as he plays. At the time the painting was made, literature of the Symbolist movement included blind characters who possessed powers of inner vision. The thin, skeleton-like figure of the blind musician also has roots in art from Picasso's native country, Spain. 

Like many of his artworks created during the Blue Period, the Old Guitarist also had older sketches underneath that may not be visible to the naked eye but are apparent when placed underneath an X-ray machine. Because the piece bore many layers of paint, the Old Guitarist appears to have a choppy feel and appearance, which depicts Picassoâ€™s strong emotions and the ever-changing mind of a painter.
